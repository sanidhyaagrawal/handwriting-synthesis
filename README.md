***A website that creates a font out of your very own handwriting in just 2 easy steps and then uses it to convert plain text copied from the internet into pdf with that text rendered in your very own handwriting with 127 layers of randomness, making it as human-like as possible.***

Tired of wasting various hours each day on hand-writing college assignments, I took it upon myself to automate it.

- Copy text from the internet, paste it on the website, hit the render button, and wallah! a pdf with whole text written in your own handwriting, with page skew, 127 layers of randomization on alphabets, all ready to be posted, and get that sweet-sweet GPA.
